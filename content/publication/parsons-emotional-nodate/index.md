abstract: The Combined Cognitive Bias Hypothesis proposes that emotional information
  processing biases associate with each other and may interact to conjointly influence
  mental health. Yet, little is known about the interrelationships amongst cognitive
  biases, particularly in adolescence. We used data from the CogBIAS longitudinal
  study (Booth et al. 2017), including 451 adolescents who completed measures of interpretation
  bias, memory bias, and a validated measure of general mental health in a typical
  population. We used a moderated network modelling approach to examine positive mental
  health related moderation of the cognitive bias network. Mental health was directly
  connected to positive and negative memory biases, and positive interpretation biases,
  but not negative interpretation biases. Further, we observed some mental health
  related moderation of the network structure. Network connectivity decreased with
  higher positive mental health scores. Network approaches allow us to model complex
  relationships amongst cognitive biases and develop novel hypotheses for future research.
