abstract: Abstract  Resilience is a dynamic process depicted by better than expected
  levels of functioning in response to significant adversity. This can be assessed
  statistically, by taking the residuals from a model of psychological functioning
  regressed onto negative life events. We report the first study to investigate multiple
  cognitive factors in relation to this depiction of resilient functioning. Life events,
  internalizing symptoms, and a range of cognitive risk and protective factors were
  assessed in a large sample of adolescents ( N = 504) across three waves spaced 12â€“18
  months apart. Adolescents who displayed fewer symptoms than expected, relative to
  negative life events, were considered more resilient. Adolescents who displayed
  more symptoms than expected, relative to negative life events, were considered less
  resilient. All cognitive factors were associated with resilient functioning to differing
  degrees. These included memory bias, interpretation bias, worry, rumination, self-esteem,
  and self-reported trait resilience. Regression models showed that memory bias was
  a key factor explaining unique variance in prospective resilient functioning. In
  a subsequent cross-lagged panel model, memory bias and resilient functioning were
  reinforcing mechanisms across time points, supporting cognitive models of emotional
  resilience. This study adds to the literature, by highlighting key cognitive mechanisms
  as potential intervention targets
