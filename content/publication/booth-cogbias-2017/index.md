abstract: 'Background: Optimal psychological development is dependent upon a complex
  interplay between individual and situational factors. Investigating the development
  of these factors in adolescence will help to improve understanding of emotional
  vulnerability and resilience. The CogBIAS longitudinal study (CogBIAS-L-S) aims
  to combine cognitive and genetic approaches to investigate risk and protective factors
  associated with the development of mood and impulsivity-related outcomes in an adolescent
  sample. Methods: CogBIAS-L-S is a three-wave longitudinal study of typically developing
  adolescents conducted over 4 years, with data collection at age 12, 14 and 16. At
  each wave participants will undergo multiple assessments including a range of selective
  cognitive processing tasks (e.g. attention bias, interpretation bias, memory bias)
  and psychological self-report measures (e.g. anxiety, depression, resilience). Saliva
  samples will also be collected at the baseline assessment for genetic analyses.
  Multilevel statistical analyses will be performed to investigate the developmental
  trajectory of cognitive biases on psychological functioning, as well as the influence
  of genetic moderation on these relationships. Discussion: CogBIAS-L-S represents
  the first longitudinal study to assess multiple cognitive biases across adolescent
  development and the largest study of its kind to collect genetic data. It therefore
  provides a unique opportunity to understand how genes and the environment influence
  the development and maintenance of cognitive biases and provide insight into risk
  and protective factors that may be key targets for intervention.'
