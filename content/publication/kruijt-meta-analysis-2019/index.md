abstract: It is widely believed that anxiety is characterized by a tendency to orient
  attention specifically toward threatening information and that this tendency (called
  attention bias) can be measured using a computer task called the “dot-probe task.”
  Over the past decade, studies have tested whether a training version of this task
  can be used to modify bias, which might then be used as a new treatment (Attention
  Bias Modification). We analyzed levels of attention bias measured before participants
  started the modification training in 13 studies enrolling 1,005 diagnosed anxious
  patients. We found no evidence that clinically anxious people are characterized
  by attention bias toward threat.
