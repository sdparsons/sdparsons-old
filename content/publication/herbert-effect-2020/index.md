abstract: The objective of this study is to determine whether attention toward fear
  messages is affected by variation in the controllability of the associated danger.
  There is no consensus regarding the effectiveness of fear appeals in driving adaptive
  behaviour, and it may be the case that threat messages fail to capture attention
  if the associated danger is not explicitly controllable. One hundred and sixty undergraduate
  university students completed a computer task that involved exposure to threat cues
  signalling a danger (money loss). In high control blocks, attending to threat cues
  provided a high chance of avoiding the danger, whereas in low control blocks, attending
  to threat cues provided little chance of avoiding the danger. Attentional capture
  by threat was measured. A mixed-design analysis of variance showed there was greater
  attentional capture by threat cues in high control blocks compared with low control
  blocks. This effect was observed with a short stimulus exposure duration and was
  magnified with a long exposure duration. Fear appeals could capture attention to
  a greater degree if the danger related to the threat message was communicated as
  being controllable. This has significant practical implications for the implementation
  of fear appeals.
