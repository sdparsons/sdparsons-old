abstract: The relationship between measurement reliability and statistical power is
  a complex one. Where reliability is deﬁned by classical test theory as the proportion
  of ‘true’ variance to total variance (the sum of true score and error variance),
  power is only functionally related to total variance. Therefore, to explore direct
  relationships between reliability and power, one must hold either true-score variance
  or error variance constant while varying the other. Here, visualisations are used
  to illustrate the reliability-power relationship under conditions of ﬁxed true-score
  variance and ﬁxed error variance. From these visualisations, conceptual distinctions
  between ﬁxing true-score or error variance can be raised. Namely, when true-score
  variance is ﬁxed, low reliability (and low power) suggests a true eﬀect may be hidden
  by error. Whereas, when error variance is ﬁxed, high reliability (and low power)
  may simply suggest a very small eﬀect. I raise several observations I hope will
  be useful in considering the utility of measurement reliability and it’s relationship
  to eﬀect sizes and statistical power.
