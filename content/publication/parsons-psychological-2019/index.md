abstract: Psychological science relies on behavioral measures to assess cognitive
  processing; however, the field has not yet developed a tradition of routinely examining
  the reliability of these behavioral measures. Reliable measures are essential to
  draw robust inferences from statistical analyses, and subpar reliability has severe
  implications for measuresâ€™ validity and interpretation. Without examining and reporting
  the reliability of measurements used in an analysis, it is nearly impossible to
  ascertain whether results are robust or have arisen largely from measurement error.
  In this article, we propose that researchers adopt a standard practice of estimating
  and reporting the reliability of behavioral assessments of cognitive processing.
  We illustrate the need for this practice using an example from experimental psychopathology,
  the dot-probe task, although we argue that reporting reliability is relevant across
  fields (e.g., social cognition and cognitive psychology). We explore several implications
  of low measurement reliability and the detrimental impact that failure to assess
  measurement reliability has on interpretability and comparison of results and therefore
  research quality. We argue that researchers in the field of cognition need to report
  measurement reliability as routine practice so that more reliable assessment tools
  can be developed. To provide some guidance on estimating and reporting reliability,
  we describe the use of bootstrapped split-half estimation and intraclass correlation
  coefficients to estimate internal consistency and test-retest reliability, respectively.
  For future researchers to build upon current results, it is imperative that all
  researchers provide psychometric information sufficient for estimating the accuracy
  of inferences and informing further development of cognitive-behavioral assessments.
