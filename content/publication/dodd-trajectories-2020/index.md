abstract: Preschool predictors of childrenâ€™s anxiety symptoms and state anxiety (reported
  daily) over the transition to school at age 4 were examined. Specifically, attention
  biases to angry and happy faces, relative to neutral, and an avoidant temperament
  style known as behavioral inhibition (BI) were examined as predictors. BI predicted
  anxiety symptoms and state anxiety. There was no evidence that attention biases
  directly predicted anxiety, although biases interacted with temperament to predict
  trajectories of state anxiety over the transition.
