abstract: 'The open science movement is rapidly changing the scientific landscape.
  Because exact definitions are often lacking and reforms are constantly evolving,
  accessible guides to open science are needed. This paper provides an introduction
  to open science and related reforms in the form of an annotated reading list of
  seven peer-reviewed articles, following the format of Etz, Gronau, Dablander, Edelsbrunner,
  and Baribault (2018). Written for researchers and students – particularly in psychological
  science – it highlights and introduces seven topics: understanding open science;
  open access; open data, materials, and code; reproducible analyses; preregistration
  and registered reports; replication research; and teaching open science. For each
  topic, we provide a detailed summary of one particularly informative and actionable
  article and suggest several further resources. Supporting a broader understanding
  of open science issues, this overview should enable researchers to engage with,
  improve, and implement current open, transparent, reproducible, replicable, and
  cumulative scientific practices.'
