abstract: The development of negative cognitive biases, together with symptoms of
  anxiety and depression, has yet to be investigated longitudinally. Using a three-wave
  design, the present study examined developmental trajectories of anxiety and depressive
  symptoms and the co-occurrence of cognitive biases, in a large normative sample
  of adolescents (N = 504). Data was drawn from the CogBIAS Longitudinal Study (CogBIAS-L-S),
  which assessed a wide range of psychological variables, including cognitive biases
  and self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, when adolescents were approximately
  13, 14.5, and 16 years of age. The results showed that overall levels of anxiety
  were low and stable, while levels of depression were low but increased slightly
  at each wave. Growth mixture modeling identified four distinct developmental classes
  with regard to anxiety and depressive symptoms. Multiple group analysis further
  showed that class membership was related to the development of cognitive biases.
  The majority of the sample (75%) was characterised by ‘Low symptoms’ of anxiety
  and depression and showed low interpretation and memory biases for negative stimuli
  at each wave. A second class (11%) displayed ‘Decreasing anxiety symptoms’ and showed
  decreasing interpretation bias, but increasing memory bias. A third class (8%) displayed
  ‘Comorbid increasing symptoms’ and showed increasing interpretation and memory biases.
  While the fourth class (6%) displayed ‘Comorbid decreasing symptoms’ and showed
  decreasing interpretation and memory biases. This longitudinal study sheds light
  on healthy and psychopathological emotional development in adolescence and highlights
  cognitive mechanisms that may be useful targets for prevention and early interventions.
