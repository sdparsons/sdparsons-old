abstract: Attentional bias to threat cues is most adaptive when the dangers they signal
  can readily be controlled by timely action. This study examined whether heightened
  trait anxiety is associated with impaired alignment between attentional bias to
  threat and variation in the controllability of danger, and whether this is moderated
  by executive functioning. Participants completed a task in which threat cues signalled
  money loss and an aversive noise burst (the danger). In ‘high control’ blocks, attending
  to the threat cue offered a high chance of avoiding this danger. In ‘low control’
  blocks, attending to the threat cue offered little control over the danger. The
  task yielded measures of attentional monitoring for threat, and attentional orienting
  to threat. Results indicated all participants showed greater attentional orienting
  to threat cues in high control relative to low control blocks (indicative of proper
  alignment), however, high trait-anxious participants showed no difference in attentional
  monitoring for threat between block types, whereas low trait-anxious participants
  did. This effect was moderated by N-Back scores. These results suggest heightened
  trait anxiety may be associated with impaired alignment of attentional monitoring
  for threat cues, and that such alignment deficit may be attenuated by high executive
  functioning.
