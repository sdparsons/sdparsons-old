abstract: There is ongoing debate surrounding the efficacy of Cognitive Bias Modification
  (CBM) for the reduction of emotional vulnerability. In part, the debate stems from
  researchers asking different questions of the existing research. Specifically, differences
  depend on whether researchers were interested in; the clinical effects of CBM procedures
  (did CBM reduce emotional vulnerability, irrespective of an assessment of bias change?),
  or the clinical effects of successfully modifying the cognitive bias process of
  interest via CBM (did CBM change the targeted bias, and did this change in bias
  predict reductions in emotional vulnerability?). Here, three considerations are
  raised that, regardless of the research question of interest, have yet to be fully
  addressed in moving forward with CBM research. First, the need for clarity in study
  designs to determine which question is being addressed. Second, CBM interventions
  that routinely produce the intended change in bias need to be developed before addressing
  whether there is any subsequent change in emotional vulnerability. Third, this relies
  on developing reliable assessments of bias as an essential foundation for addressing
  any further questions about processes or procedures.
